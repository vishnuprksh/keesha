# Confirmation Dialog Implementation for Delete Operations

## Summary
Successfully implemented confirmation dialogs for all delete operations in the Keesha expense tracker app to prevent accidental deletions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AccountManager.tsx**
- Added imports for `ConfirmDialog` and `useConfirmDialog`
- Added confirmation dialog hook: `const { isOpen, openDialog, closeDialog, dialogConfig } = useConfirmDialog()`
- Created `handleDeleteAccount()` function that shows confirmation dialog
- Updated delete button to use `handleDeleteAccount(account)` instead of direct `onDeleteAccount(account.id)`
- Added `<ConfirmDialog>` component with proper props at the end of the component

### 2. **TransactionList.tsx**
- Added imports for `ConfirmDialog` and `useConfirmDialog`
- Added confirmation dialog hook
- Created `handleDeleteTransaction()` function that shows confirmation dialog
- Updated delete button to use `handleDeleteTransaction(transaction)` instead of direct `onDeleteTransaction(transaction.id)`
- Added `<ConfirmDialog>` component with proper props

### 3. **TransactionsPage.tsx**
- Added imports for `ConfirmDialog` and `useConfirmDialog`
- Added confirmation dialog hook
- Created `handleDeleteTransaction()` function that shows confirmation dialog
- Updated delete button to use `handleDeleteTransaction(transaction)` instead of direct `onDeleteTransaction(transaction.id)`
- Added `<ConfirmDialog>` component with proper props

### 4. **ExpenseList.tsx**
- Added imports for `ConfirmDialog` and `useConfirmDialog`
- Added confirmation dialog hook
- Created `handleDeleteExpense()` function that shows confirmation dialog
- Updated delete button to use `handleDeleteExpense(expense)` instead of direct `onDeleteExpense(expense.id)`
- Added `<ConfirmDialog>` component with proper props

## Features Implemented

### Confirmation Dialog Properties
- **Title**: Clear indication of what's being deleted (e.g., "Delete Account", "Delete Transaction")
- **Message**: Shows the name/title of the item being deleted and warns that the action cannot be undone
- **Confirm Button**: Red "Delete" button to proceed with deletion
- **Cancel Button**: Gray "Cancel" button to abort the operation
- **Type**: Set to "danger" for red styling to indicate destructive action

### User Experience
- All delete operations now require explicit confirmation
- Clear messaging about what will be deleted
- Visual indication that this is a destructive action (red confirm button)
- Easy cancellation option
- Modal dialog prevents accidental clicks outside

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- `ConfirmDialog`: Existing reusable modal component
- `useConfirmDialog`: Existing hook for managing dialog state

### Dialog Configuration
```typescript
openDialog({
  title: 'Delete [Item Type]',
  message: `Are you sure you want to delete "${item.name}"? This action cannot be undone.`,
  onConfirm: () => {
    onDelete[Item](item.id);
    closeDialog();
  },
  confirmLabel: 'Delete',
  cancelLabel: 'Cancel',
  type: 'danger'
});
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ App compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Development server starts without issues
- ✅ All delete operations now show confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ User interface remains intuitive

## Security & Safety Benefits
1. **Prevents Accidental Deletions**: Users must explicitly confirm before any data is deleted
2. **Clear Communication**: Users see exactly what they're about to delete
3. **Reversible Action**: Users can easily cancel if they change their mind
4. **Consistent Experience**: All delete operations behave the same way across the app
5. **Visual Warnings**: Red styling clearly indicates destructive actions

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/AccountManager.tsx`
- `/src/components/TransactionList.tsx` 
- `/src/components/TransactionsPage.tsx`
- `/src/components/ExpenseList.tsx`

## Dependencies Used
- Existing `ConfirmDialog` component (`/src/components/common/ConfirmDialog.tsx`)
- Existing `useConfirmDialog` hook (`/src/hooks/useConfirmDialog.ts`)

All changes leverage existing infrastructure, ensuring consistency with the app's design patterns and minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
