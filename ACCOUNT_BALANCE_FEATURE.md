# Account Balance Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added real-time account balance tracking to the transactions display. Users can now see how their account balances change after each transaction.

## Features Added

### 1. TransactionsPage Balance Column
- Added a new "Account Balances" column to the transactions table
- Shows running balances for both From and To accounts after each transaction
- Uses chronological order to calculate accurate running balances
- Displays balances in small, organized cards within each transaction row

### 2. TransactionList Balance Display
- Added balance information to the transaction cards on the Home page
- Shows account balances after each transaction in a clean, organized format
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing card-based layout

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Leveraged existing `calculateRunningBalances` utility from `utils/balanceCalculator.ts`
- Added `useMemo` optimization to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing for all new components

## Files Modified

### Components
- `src/components/TransactionsPage.tsx`: Added balance column and calculation logic
- `src/components/TransactionList.tsx`: Added balance display to transaction cards

### Styles
- `src/styles/transactions.css`: Added CSS styling for balance displays

## How It Works

1. **Balance Calculation**: Uses the existing `calculateRunningBalances` function to compute account balances after each transaction in chronological order

2. **Display Logic**: 
   - For each transaction, shows the balance of both affected accounts
   - Only shows balances for accounts that actually change
   - Avoids duplicate display when transferring between the same account

3. **Performance**: 
   - Uses `useMemo` to cache calculations and prevent unnecessary recalculations
   - Only recalculates when transactions or accounts change

## User Benefits

- **Real-time Balance Tracking**: See exactly how each transaction affects account balances
- **Financial Clarity**: Better understanding of account status at any point in time
- **Visual Organization**: Clean, non-intrusive display that enhances rather than clutters the interface
- **Chronological Accuracy**: Balances are calculated in the correct order based on transaction dates

## UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Balance displays adapt to different screen sizes
- **Color-coded Display**: Uses consistent color scheme with the rest of the app
- **Compact Layout**: Efficient use of space with small, organized balance cards
- **Clear Labeling**: Account names are clearly visible with balance amounts

## Future Enhancements

- Add balance change indicators (↑/↓ arrows)
- Include percentage change calculations
- Add balance history charts
- Implement balance alerts/notifications

This feature significantly enhances the financial tracking capabilities of the Keesha app by providing real-time visibility into how transactions affect account balances.
