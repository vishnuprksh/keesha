// CORRECTED THINKING MODE IMPLEMENTATION

/* 
âœ… FIXED: Based on reference API code, we now properly handle thinking mode:

BEFORE (incorrect):
- Used spread operator to conditionally include thinkingConfig
- Omitted thinkingConfig entirely when thinking mode was off

AFTER (correct):
- Always include thinkingConfig in config
- Set thinkingBudget: 0 when thinking mode is disabled  
- Set thinkingBudget: -1 when thinking mode is enabled

This matches the official API pattern:
*/

// Main processing config:
const config = {
  temperature: 0,
  maxOutputTokens: 32768,
  thinkingConfig: {
    thinkingBudget: useThinkingMode ? -1 : 0,  // âœ… Correct approach
  },
  responseMimeType: 'text/plain',
  // ...
};

// Same pattern applied to chunk processing config

/* 
ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. PDFImport component:
   - Toggle defaults to FALSE (thinking mode OFF)
   - Clear UI with "Think Harder ðŸ§ " label
   - Passes useThinkingMode to GeminiService

2. GeminiService:
   - Always includes thinkingConfig
   - thinkingBudget: 0 = no thinking (fast)
   - thinkingBudget: -1 = unlimited thinking (slow but accurate)
   - Added logging to show current mode

3. Benefits:
   - Default fast processing for large documents
   - User can enable thinking for complex/problematic imports
   - Proper API usage following official patterns
