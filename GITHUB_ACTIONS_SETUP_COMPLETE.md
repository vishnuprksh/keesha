   - **Name**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEESHA_10560`

## 🚀 Deployment Flow

### Automatic Deployments:

- **Merges to main/master**: Deploys to live production site

### Manual Deployment:
```bash
# Local deployment (if needed)
npm run build
firebase deploy --project keesha-10560
```

## 🔍 Verification

Run the verification script to check everything:

./verify-deployment.sh
```

## 📱 Your App URLs

After deployment, your app will be available at:
- **Production**: https://keesha-10560.web.app

3. Ensure the service account JSON is complete and valid
4. Run `./verify-deployment.sh` to check configuration
